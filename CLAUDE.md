# Claude Code Instructions

## Development Workflow

- Develop in the smallest testable chunks possible
- Create a new branch for each chunk of work
- Each branch should contain one focused feature, bug fix, or improvement
- Create a PR from each branch into master
- Ensure each chunk is independently testable and deployable
